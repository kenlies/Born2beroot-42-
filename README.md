# Born2beroot
A Hive Project where we had to install a linux-based server on a VM, and set some funky things in it.

1. We had to partion our virtual machine using LVM into 2 encrypted section. (Example in subject)
2. Setup UFW & SSH on port 4242. Install Sudo.
3. Change hostname, add a strong password policy and a normal user on the system with set privileges and groups. 
4. Set strong configuration for your sudo group.
5. We had to develope a monitoring script on bash. At server startup, the script will display some information on all terminals every 10 minutes.
FOR BONUSES: I did the first one, so partions as shown in the bonus partion example. 

In addition, in the evalpdf, we had to explain how the tools, software and protocols we used, work. Plus other stuff like adding users etc. 

The signature.txt file is just a shasum of the VM instance added to our git repo for project evaluations.
